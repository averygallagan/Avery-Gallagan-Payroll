# Avery-Gallagan-Payroll
Week Three Payroll Manager

This week we had to add javascript to an existing code to add employee information to the page.

The add employee button when clicked will bring up 3 prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary. This will be followed up by a message asking if you would like to add another employee.

The data is then stored and outputted in a table on the page. This info is sorted by last name and the salaries are converted to a numerical value.

Inside the console there is two functions: one for displaying the average salaries of all listed employees and one for selecting a random employee.
